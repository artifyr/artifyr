## About me:
>Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing BCA in Cloud Tech and Information Security at Jain University, Bangalore. I'm a 3d Artist and I code as a hobby. I am always ready to take up new tasks and quickly adapt to new needs and places. I have good team-leading skills and can quickly pick up new software.
